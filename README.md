# Hangman Python Project
 Hangman is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A cruel computer hides a word from you, which you try to guess letter by letter. If you fail, you'll be “hanged”. If you win, you'll survive. You’ve probably played the game at least once or twice. Play the game now by downloading the repository.

Learning outcomes:
With functions, loops, lists and other variables, this is a great project for Python basics. As a cherry on top, it even includes a random module & is a good go as a beginner project in Python.
